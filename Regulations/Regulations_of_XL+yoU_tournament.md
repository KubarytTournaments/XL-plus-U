- Players can *reroll* and ban 0-2 drawn towns for a fee of 500 gold. The first to *reroll* declares the winner of the coinflip. There is a maximum of one such ban per Player. If the same pair of towns is drawn as before the *reroll*, the draw must be repeated.
- Bidding of town and color begins with Player, who won coinflip. First bidding is about town, second about color.

## 4. Restarty

4.1 Red is the first that has to decide if they take a restart, blue is second. (If blue passes turn intending to take a restart, in order to not give it away, and then red does not take restart and ends turn, blue has to write 111 in the first 5 seconds after accepting his turn. After that time, blue has to play the map).

4.2 Players can take technical restarts if:

- The map is bugged, fe. a portal is missing*
- There is a guard on the road that blocks the entire passage and defeating him will result in the loss of at least 70% of your army.
- There is a guard on the road, defeating which will result in the loss of at least 70% of the army, he does not block the entire passage, but getting around him costs at least 1500 movement points.

**If the guard of the object is set incorrectly (it is possible to bypass it and use the object), a technical restart should not be performed, and the guard should be fought.*

4.3 Technical restarsts can be used from 111 to 114 inclusive. If players can't reach an agreement about technical restart, decision must be consultated with the Judge

Early meeting restarts. If players interact with each other in early turns, each of them has the right to ask for a technical restart. The last day on which that is allowed is 116 for medium roads and 117 for fast roads. Interaction between players is defined as any battle between players, or taking over any object belonging to another player (empty mines, towns, etc.). Bear in mind, if simultaneous turns get interrupted, that does not mean an interaction happened. If by the time Blue finishes their turn, there was no interaction, there are no grounds for technical reset.

## 5. Fair Play rules

5.1 Do not use crashes for your advantage. If the game is re-loaded due to a crash, the players should do their best to recreate their moves on the adventure map and in combat in the turn in which error occurred. If a judge decides that moves were not repeated faithfully enough, they can ask players to reload again. If a player purposely changed his moves to gain an advantage, the organiser can punish them with a technical loss. If after loading the game a player has more time than before, they should spend that excess with their town or hero screen open - not analyzing the game or playing. In case of low timer these actions could result in an undeserved advantage.

5.2 External help. There are many ways of getting additional information useful in an ongoing game. Below is a list of them, with a decision whether or not it’s acceptable:

- Hints (a third party provides the Player with information that can be deduced from only looking at their gameplay page) by text: Allowed, but if the hint has a significant impact on the gameplay or causes the Player to change their gameplay plan, fe. a list of steps, indication of an unnoticed earlier by the player of the object or a reminder to equip the artifact before the fight, Streamers using this type of advice will be punished with a walkover or disqualification, each such case should be reported to the Committee; Streamers should remove such suggestions, preferably through moderation.
- Advice via phone, teamspeak, skype, etc. providing voice and / or video conversations: Forbidden
- Spoilers (a third party provides a player with information that could not be logically deduced by watching only that player’s side of the game): > > > - Forbidden - if a player reads a spoiler they should play as if they haven’t seen it.
- Ghosting (watching your opponent’s stream): Forbidden
- Programs reading game’s memory - for example to see the map or foresee the skilltree of a hero: Forbidden
- Value calculators: Allowed
- Damage calculators: Allowed
- Wiki pages: Allowed
- Watching your own stream or recording of it from certain Party during this Party: Forbidden
- Screenshots: Forbidden
- Video guides: Allowed
- Personal notes about the game: Allowed
- Macros and binds: Using macros and binds that limits to simulating a combination of 2 keys, no additional delays and no cursor movements is allowed.

5.3 Using game saving for changing of movements made before them is forbidden.

5.4 Players are obliged to behave culturally to each others, during Party, before it and after it on Game chat, in private messages related to Tournament and on Discord.

5.5  Standard hota online gameplay rules. Link to them is [here](https://h3hota.com/en/rules). If a rule in the Regulations conflicts with the one in standard hota rules, the Regulations takes priority.

## 6. Kary

6.1 The Committee has several ways to punish players for non-compliance with the Regulations and in exceptional situations, not mentioned in the Regulations. Penalty levels are defined as follows:

- Warning - received for trivial infractions. First warning has no consequences, but every next warning causes additional penalties:
  - Second warning - walkover for Party
  - Third warning - disqualification
- Walkover for Party - received for small infractions,
- Walkover for Match - received for medium infractions, included failure to meet deadlines, can be combined with a warning,
- Dyskwalifikacja - received for big infractions

6.2 Committee in unusual situtations can use other than mentioned in point 7.1 type of penalty.

6.3 Informations about receiving a penatly with the reason of it will be published on Discord.

6.4 Players may appeal against the decision of the Committee at the latest on the day of the end of the phase following the phase in which they received the penalty.

## 7. Zakończenie Gry

- After the Party is played, the defeated player types “gg” both in case of the game being ranked, and in case it was not. “gg” in that case means admitting defeat, and can be a proof when writing a report. Decission about admitting defeat can't be canceled.

- Report after the finished game should be written on www.h3.gg. The report needs to be confirmed by your opponent, or a judge.

- After the game the players are obligated to exchange save passwords.
